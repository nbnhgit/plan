### Day 1: I'm All In {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade .color-tabs}

<h3>**Scripture**</h3>

**Joshua 14:6-15 NIV**

6. Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the Lord said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me. 

7. I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions, 

8. but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly. 

9. So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.’

10. “Now then, just as the Lord promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old! 

11. I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then. 

12. Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the Lord helping me, I will drive them out just as he said.”

13. Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. 

14. So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the Lord, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly. 

15. (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.)
Then the land had rest from war.

### Day 2: Heart On Fire {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade .color-tabs}

#### 
<h3>**Scripture**</h3>

**Proverbs 7:1-4 KJV**

1. My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

2. Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.

3. Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.

4. Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:

#### 
<h3>**Temperature**</h3>

* Gauging your passions and feelings can be very difficult in a society that is hyper-sensational. One must always check if ones heart is burning at the right temperature for the priority of the passion.

* If your to cold, somethings may come to close that you've been trying to avoid or should avoid. If your to hot you may just destroy the very thing you're trying to protect.

* The key is in the balance, and that balance is found in the peace of the voices that council you.

#### 
<h3>**Heart On Fire**</h3>

* Never let passion override priority.

* Never let passion override making decisions from a place of peace.

* Any subject area needs a level of passion or fire, but the temperature and use case is determined by what councils you.

### Day 3: Stick To It {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade .color-tabs}

<h3>**Scripture**</h3>

**Jonah 1:1-17 KJV**

1. Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,

2. Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.

3. But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.

4. But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

5. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

6. So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.

7. And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

8. Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?

9. And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.

10. Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.

11. Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.

12. And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.

13. Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.

14. Wherefore they cried unto the Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.

15. So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.

16. Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord, and made vows.

17. Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

#### 
<h3>**Keep The Cup**</h3>

* When we are faced with difficult situations do we run, hide or go into denial? Like Jesus we all have a cup to bear. And when It was to much and he prayed to God, but still had to bear it.

* It’s common to have nightmares of being chased; we run because we have a weak character, or lazy.

* When Jonah ran he didn’t deny who God was, he told the men who God was; choosing to keep the cup. 

#### 
<h3>**Love Wholeheartedly **</h3>

* It’s ok not to be ok, It’s ok to get sad but not depressed, It’s ok to be angry but don’t sin, It’s ok to be broken but don’t fall apart 

* You will never have complete control over everything and everyone 

* God kept him safe by having Jonah swallowed. If you have to endure being swallowed, You will be spit out. Stick to God because he Stuck to you.
